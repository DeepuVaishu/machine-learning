# Logistic Regression for Classification Problems

This project demonstrates how to use Logistic Regression for solving classification problems using the Breast Cancer Dataset from Scikit-Learn.

## 🔍 Overview
Logistic Regression is a supervised learning algorithm used for classification tasks. This project covers:
- Binary classification using the Breast Cancer dataset.
- Model evaluation using metrics like accuracy, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.
- Visualization of the ROC Curve and Confusion Matrix.

## 🛠 Features
- **Dataset**: Scikit-Learn's Breast Cancer Dataset
- **Algorithm**: Logistic Regression
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Accuracy, F1-score, Confusion Matrix, and ROC-AUC
- **Visualizations**:
  - ROC Curve
  - Confusion Matrix Heatmap
